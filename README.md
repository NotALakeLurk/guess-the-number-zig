# Guess The Number
A simple guess the number game written in Zig. 

## Installation / Running
1. Download the source code (clone the repo, download a zip, whatever)
2. Execute `$ zig build run`

## "Why Did You Make This?"
I made this because I wanted a super simple project that I could work on to learn the basics of Zig and its toolkit.

## "Can I Modify This?"
Of course! Go ahead! Heck, make a pull request if you think you've got something that really needs in (for whatever reason, lol).
